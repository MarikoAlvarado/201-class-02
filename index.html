            <p>I live in Bellingham, WA. I have a wife, 3.5 year old son, and a 1.5 year old daughter. We do not have any pets. We love to travel, but Covid put a damper on that this summer. In our time before kids, my wife and I lived overseas in Tunis, Tunisia for 3 years, which was a great experience! Until recently, I was the operations manager for a equipment manufacturing startup. My ultimate goal at Code Fellows is to become a proficient programmer and land a remote position that would allow me the flexibility to work from different locations.</p>
