## About Me with a Guessing Game

This app prompts a user for their name and then asks them to play a guessing game regarding random facts about the page author. The user is alerted to the correct answer after each question. Upon completion of the guessing game, the user is thanked for playing and the page is displayed with some biographical info about the author.

### Links and Resources

- Found CSS font styles at w3schools.com
- Found out how to create a sticky header using the `position: fixed;` via W3schools.com
- Figured out how to use `parseInt();` to force users input to be a number via W3school.com

### Reflections and Comments

- Figured out how proper padding and margin can make a big difference in page appearance
- Learned that reset.css can in fact override some styles indicated in app.js if they are overly broad. For instance, in this case attempting to us a `*{ border: solid black 1px}` did not work for all elements because the reset had more specifically defined borders for a few elements.
